# Improved-substitution-Techniques

Security is the area which has to be prioritized in every organization. Inorder to protect
the sensitive data of the user, there are many existing algorithms which are unique in their
own way. One such is the elgamal algorithm which is based on the concept of digital
signature. The most significant aspect of Public-key Cryptography is Digital Signature,
which provides a set of security features that would be difficult to achieve in any other
method, particularly for establishing the data's validity. We use substitution techniques in
cryptography to encrypt the plain text to the cipher text. In this research, we had
combined both the substitution technique along with the Digital signature to ensure more
security during the authentication process. User will be creating the password along with
it he/she has to remember the timestamp of the creation of the password. Using
substitution technique we get a polynomial which is then triple Integrated with the
timestamp value as limits.The obtained message digest value is sent as input to the
Elgamal algorithm by following the standard procedure which is then verified at the later
part of the algorithm thus making the password encryption more secure.
